1. Say True or False for the below statements: 
• Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes? 
     False

• Base R packages installed automatically? 
      False

2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
       Recycling occurs when vector arithmetic is performed on multiple vectors of different sizes.
 R takes the shorter vector and repeats them until it becomes long enough to match the longer one.

3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
      Suppose we have two Vectors c(1,2,4) , c(6,0,9,10,13), where the first one is shorter with only 3 elements. 
   Now if we sum these two, we will get a warning message as follows.
    > c(1,2,4) + c(6,0,9,10,13)
    [1]  7  2 13 11 15
  Warning message:
    In c(1, 2, 4) + c(6, 0, 9, 10, 13) :  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

    Here R , Sum those Vectors by Recycling or repeating the elements in shorter one, until it is long enough to match the longer one as follows..

    > c(1,2,4,1,2) + c(6,0,9,10,13)
      [1]  7  2 13 11 15
